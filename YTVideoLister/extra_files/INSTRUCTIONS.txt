1. To run the program, click on YTVideoLister.exe

2. The program will start listing videos of the chosen channel* in the console
   window, 10** at a time. They will be presented in the reverse chronological
   order. Use N and P buttons on the keyboard to go through the pages of found
   videos (N = [N]ext page, P = [P]revious page). Once you've seen the name of
   the video that you'd like to watch, note its number and close the program.
   A "output.txt" file should now be present next to the program executable and
   other files. Open it with your text editor of choice, and you'll find the
   link to your video under the same number, along with the video description.
   Copy the link to your browser's URL bar and enjoy your spoiler-free video!
   (In some text editors, like Notepad++, you can simply click on the link.)   
   
* Note: This can be changed in the "config.txt" file found next to the program
  executable.
